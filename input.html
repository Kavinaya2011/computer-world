    <h1>INPUT DEVICE</h1>
    <p>In computing, an input device is a piece of equipment used <br> to provide data and control signals to an information processing system,<br> such as a computer or information appliance. Examples of input devices include<br> keyboards, computer mice, scanners, cameras, joysticks, and microphones.

     <br>   Input devices can be categorized based on:
        
        modality of input <br>(e.g., mechanical motion, audio, visual, etc.)
        whether the input is discrete <br>(e.g., pressing of key) or continuous (e.g., a mouse's position, <br>though digitized into a discrete quantity, is fast enough to be considered continuous)<br>
        the number of degrees of freedom involved<br>(e.g., two-dimensional traditional mice, or three-dimensional navigators designed for CAD applications)</p>
